Problem
You have three arrays: a, b and c, of the same length, containing integers, e.g.

a = [1,1,1,2,8,6,1]

b = [2,4,6,1,4,18,61]

c = [2,8,18,2,1,1,8]


We need to loop over them and print out their contents in columns with a row containing a number 
from each list. However, for these numbers the order they are in across the arrays does not matter, for 
example (1,2,2) == (2,2,1) == (2,1,2). We also do not want to print duplicates. The final output for the 
example above should be:

 a b c
 
 1 2 2
 
 1 4 8
 
 1 6 18
 
 1 61 8
 
Task
Please implement a piece of code to solve the problem described above in a language of your choice
